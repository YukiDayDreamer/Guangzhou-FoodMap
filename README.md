# GuangzhouFoodMap

Demo: http://foodmapguangzhou.azurewebsites.net

Guangzhou is famous for its food in China. The original idea of this project is me and my group in Guangzhou want to share their oppinions with friends who are not familar with Guangzhou, and provide some local suggestions. Since there are some similar apps providing suggestions for new visitors to Guangzhou, but the spotlight of this app is that it is not only providing the restaurant informations, but also a complete route for them to view and follow.

This mobile web app is arranged in the style of Esri Story Maps and with extra information about the rating, price, and more!

Similar to Esri Story Map, there are 3 views of pages: List, Map, and Details.

This app also simulates some animations in the Esri Story Map:

- In the **Map View**, click icon on the map or swipe the introduction could trigger the switch of different items, while click the introduction would redirect to its Details View
- In the **Details View**, swipe would trigger the switch of different items as well
- In the **List View**, click item would redirect to its Details View

From Left to Right: List View, Map View, Details View

Also it could embed another information map in the Details View:
